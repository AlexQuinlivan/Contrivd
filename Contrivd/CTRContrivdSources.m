commander Inspector Dave Gaskin said it was good to be able to return David to his family.</p> <p>&quot;We are pleased that we have been able to return David to his immediate family. He was lost in tragic circumstances doing a sport he loved. Canterbury police will continue to support David's family as they come to terms with David being returned to them over 41 years after he went missing.&quot;</p> <p>A statement from Moen's family released by police said they were glad to have David returned to them.</p> <p>&quot;We cannot put into words what it feels like to have David returned to us after all this time, but we are taken back to when he first went missing back in 1973. We are a very close family and losing David so unexpectedly was really hard on us all and his loss was felt enormously by us and his friends. David was friendly with everyone and lived life to the full.&nbsp; He had an infectious sense of humour and was always smiling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;David shared his love of the outdoors with other members of the family. He learned to climb at school where he was a Queens Scout and continued to learn and hone his climbing skills. He was a great outdoorsman making his loss that much harder to comprehend.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;We are very grateful for the support of our family and friends, particularly while the remains were being identified and we just didn't know whether it was David or not.&nbsp; It has been a very difficult process for everyone involved and we would like to thank Canterbury police who have been extremely supportive, respectful and compassionate and this has brought us great comfort, knowing they were there for us.</p> <p>David's spirit still remains in the beautiful, peaceful environment which claimed the life of a wonderful and dearly loved young man in the prime of his life.&quot;</p>\",\n            \"images\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": 11817131,\n

will ensure an added edge to a 2017 regatta that was waning from public focus with the ongoing problems at Team New Zealand and the questionable changes by America's Cup bosses over the details of the Bermuda event.</p> <p>Will Barker come back to haunt his old team? Can he make the Japanese competitive in a game of catchup? Will he raid the surplus Kiwi talent to try to help the Asian syndicate?</p> <p>Barker's departure from Team New Zealand drew a mixed response. Many agreed that after 20 years in the game and three consecutive failures he had done his time as the man at the helm. But most felt his axing from the wheel was very poorly handled.</p> <p>The classy Barker made a dignified exit on his own terms, politely refusing the coaching job that was offered as an alternative and hardly uttering a bitter word about his old bosses as he sailed off into the sunset.</p> <p>But he's come back over the horizon and will certainly have Team New Zealand in his sights in his new position that involves work on and off the water as chief executive and skipper.</p> <p>Team New Zealand are proven old hands in this murky game and will back their experience to be competitive again. They have design information that has repeatedly kept them at or near the head of the pack. But the field has evened out in that area with one-design elements being introduced to make a more even fleet.</p> <p>And while Team New Zealand continue to search every salty corner of the globe to try to uncover the millions needed to stay on course, Barker will have the luxury of putting his hand out to Team Japan's benefactor, SoftBank boss Masoyashi Son, whose wealth is estimated to be US$22 billion (NZ$29b), making him Japan's wealthiest man.</p> <p>Masoyashi hasn't entered this game to make up the numbers. He is serious about trying to win the America's Cup and the hiring of Barker is another sign of that.</p> <p>Barker knows the ins and outs of this game as well as anyone going around at the moment. He will be desperate to make the most of this unexpected second chance. It's a silver lining to the darkest time of his storied career.&nbsp;You can also bet Barker is being paid handsomely for his efforts – undoubtedly far more than his undisclosed salary with the Kiwi syndicate.</p> <p>Money won't win the America's Cup… but it sure helps. Just ask the last two men to have their hands on the Auld Mug – Swiss billionaire Ernesto Bertarelli, who hijacked Kiwi talent to man his successful Alinghi team, and Larry Ellison, one of the world's richest men who enticed New Zealand's greatest Cup sailor, Sir Russell Coutts, to oversee his successful challenge and subsequent defence.</p> <p>Sound familiar?</p>\",\n            \"images\": [\n

may be dangling by a thread.</p> <p>Southern Cross Cable Network confirmed a segment of its cable network between Oregon and San Jose in the United States was cut at about 1am New Zealand time by a contractor working for the state's transport department.</p> <p>Southern Cross spokeswoman Rosemay Foot said repairs had been underway but she was unable to confirm if they had been completed.</p> <p>A document tweeted by Auckland telecommunications executive Liam Farr indicated the cut had required internet traffic between the US and Australia to be re-routed via New Zealand.</p> <p>Foot was unable to confirm that. However, if the report is correct, it appears possible a further cable cut could have compromised New Zealand's communications with the rest of the world.</p> <p>Southern Cross' network is configured as a &quot;figure of eight&quot; centred on Hawaii and is designed so there is always a back-up route if one section of the cable is cut.</p> <p>The land-based &quot;E2&quot; segment of the cable that runs between Oregon and San Jose has an addition terrestrial back-up, however, making it unclear why international traffic would have required re-routing. Further comment has been sought from Southern Cross.</p> <p>Foot said New Zealand customers of Southern Cross had not been affected by the cable cut and nor had other customers who had paid for capacity via a back-up route.</p> <p>However, it had had some impact on customers outside New Zealand who had not paid for &quot;protected circuits&quot;. &nbsp;</p> <p>Southern Cross Cable Network confirmed the incident several hours after it was first approached by Stuff for comment.</p> <p>Several attempts have been made to build a business case for an additional fibre-optic cable that would link New Zealand to the US and reduce the country's reliance on Southern Cross.</p> <p>Hawaiki Cable secured a carrier licence in April from Communications Minister Amy Adams for its proposed subsea cable that would run between Sydney, Whangarei and Oregon.</p> <p>However, it has yet to confirm it has secured the US$300 million ($410m) in funding that it needs to begin construction.</p>\",\n

Who can blame the host who has been at the helm for more than&nbsp;a decade? It would have been too humiliating to stay on in a show that previously bore your name on it, the Campbell brand having stood for something as it fought for the underdog and took on a Government that over the last few years consistently turned down numerous invitations to appear on the show to battle it out with the passionate host.</p> <p>Six weeks ago, when the axing of the show was first raised, fans rushed to its aid, parking bums on seats and demonstrating their loyalty as the ratings started to top the 6pm news bulletin. But the writing was on the wall as the show was rumoured to be too pink in its persuasion by friends of John Key, high up in the echelons of MediaWorks.</p> <p>The review was led by TV3's current affairs boss, Mark Jennings. Senior management were unanimous in the decision to side-line Campbell. By opting for co-hosts - the search having already started for fresh presenters - it indicates the new format may try and give Seven Sharp (and its signature blathering, banter and editorialising by their boy-girl presenter line-up) a run for its money.</p> <p>Campbell's passion for the job can never be doubted, as he crusaded for so many causes and issues that faced everyday New Zealanders; kids' lunches in school, child poverty, changing the drink-driving laws, raising money for the victims of natural disasters, and tirelessly battling away for the quake-affected in Christchurch.</p> <p>MediaWorks, having recently gone all out on the multimedia Paul Henry show that is failing to gain traction, has ditched a household name and angered Campbell Live's loyal fan base who won't take this lying down.</p> <p>Ten years ago, Campbell Live entered the scene as a compassionate, deeper thinking alternative to the Holmes show and stood its ground. Recent moves by MediaWorks&nbsp;to become the emperors of reality TV meant that Campbell Live became a strange fit for them.</p> <p>What is sad is that the host leaves without a well-deserved, decent send off for his services to the nation.</p> <p>Some found his over-the-top sincerity irksome, but he could not have retained that front for a decade without it being the real deal. No doubt he will resurface elsewhere.

To explain what he did next you really have to know a bit about his situation. He says he panicked. He was high on meth, and it altered his thinking. He's also on a bracelet. He's also five minutes away from being able to get back to his house for his curfew.&quot;&nbsp;</p> <p>He pointed to parts of the crown's case that didn't &quot;gel&quot;, including prosecutor's &quot;inexplicable&quot; suggestion that the accused would plan a murder, knowing full well he was being tracked electronically.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;Why would anybody wearing an electronic bracelet that tracks your movement all through the day, plan a murder that can be plotted on aerial photographs? Does that make sense?&quot; Wilkinson-Smith asked. &nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;How stupid would you have to be to lay your plans to do an abduction and murder and not make any plans for the fact you're wearing a GPS bracelet?&quot;&nbsp;</p> <p>The fact the collision was proved to have happened just minutes before the defendant's curfew expired was proof it was an accident, he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;Methamphetamine is a huge part of what happened next.&quot;</p> <p>Wilkinson-Smith said he didn't expect jurors to &quot;feel sorry&quot; for his client but asked them to put themselves in his client's shoes.&nbsp;</p> <p>Hurrying to get home after searching for drugs, and then hitting an innocent pedestrian had put the accused into a panic, he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Previously the court had heard from another driver on Salisbury Rd, who said they had swerved to avoid hitting Gotingco whom they claimed was standing in the middle of the street.&nbsp;</p> <p>After checking in the rear vision mirror, Junior Anau noticed the BMW that had previously been tail gating him had come to a stop.&nbsp;</p> <p>Wilkinson-Smith said this was evidence that supported the defendant's version of events.&nbsp;</p> <p>Wilkinson-Smith argued the GPS evidence showing the accused moving around Eskdale Cemetery prior to allegedly abducting Gotingco was &quot;nowhere near accurate enough&quot;.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;These dots are just estimates of his position and they're up to 100m out,&quot; he said.</p> <p>He criticised the storage of DNA samples that had been exposed to condensation, and said it was possible cross contamination had occurred from a sperm-stained sheet wrapping Gotingco's body, or from stains on the back seat of the car.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>VICTIM WAS 'VERY MUCH ALIVE', PROSECUTOR SAYS</b></p> <p>Prosecutor Kieran Raftery summed up the crown's case at the final day of the trial of the man accused of killing Blessie Gotingco.&nbsp;</p> <p>The 28-year old has pleaded not guilty to raping and murdering Gotingco on May 24 last year, despite admitting stabbing her after hitting her with his BMW.&nbsp;</p> <p>On Thursday Raftery began by pointing to evidence from two Salisbury Rd residents, one from a young girl who heard a high pitched scream shortly before 8pm, and another who heard a car idling outside her window where debris was later found.&nbsp;</p> <p>He pointed out that the scream didn't come until after a car could be heard stopping and idling on the street, showing Gotingco was &quot;very much alive&quot; after the impact of the accident, and certainly when she was bundled into the accused's car, he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;He knew from that moment on she was alive,&quot; Raftery said.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;To scream, you have to be very much alive. If [the witness] heard the scream, the man outside bundling her into his car would have heard the scream.</p> <p>&quot;If the crown scenario is correct, he was actually abducting someone for the purposes of raping her. He doesn't want someone who is dead, he wants someone who is very much alive.&quot;&nbsp;</p> <p>Raftery said it was &quot;highly odd&quot; that the accused had spent time in not just one, but two cemeteries, on the day Gotingco disappeared and later was found in Eskdale Cemetery.&nbsp;</p> <p>GPS movements showed he'd spent time at Eskdale Cemetery, allegedly smoking drugs, before later going to Birkenhead Cemetery where he claimed he was spending time looking at a map to figure out where Salisbury Rd was.&nbsp;</p> <p>This was the street where a &quot;man whose name he never learned&quot; allegedly told him he could score drugs, Raftery said, pointing out that the accused never bothered to go to a second street in Beach Haven where he was also told he could score.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;First of all, just thinking about it, it's just highly odd that he should go to another cemetery, when he'd just inspected one for 10 or 12 minutes and the dots tell you he's moving about within that cemetery, moving around,&quot; Raftery said.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;The (other) address he'd been given, he goes nowhere near. What does that suggest? It's a lot of nonsense. It's a story, as is the whole of his story, made up to try and fit with the evidence.&quot;&nbsp;</p> <p>The defendant alleged striking Gotingco had been an accident and he stabbed her because he believed she was already dead, and wanted it to look as if she was the victim of a random attack, in order to avoid detection.&nbsp;</p> <p>Raftery said how Gotingco came to be in the accused's garage, where he took her after hitting her, was &quot;technically irrelevant&quot; but it formed an important narrative to what ensued next.&nbsp;</p> <p>Salisbury Rd, where Gotingco got off a bus at 7.50pm, was not well lit: &quot;It's quite a good street to pick a victim.&quot;&nbsp;</p> <p>Raftery said the real reason he'd taken Gotingco back to his home could be found in the physical evidence taken from Gotingco and the garage.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;His semen was found inside her vagina. That, more than anything else, tells you why she was taken to that garage - because he wanted to have sex with her. That's why he took her there. Why else is that semen inside her?&quot; Raftery said.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;He says it's got there by police malpractice, an unidentified police officer, but you can imagine who they must be - people responsible for the search of his premises.&quot;&nbsp;</p> <p>However the police and forensic scientists would have to be &quot;particularly devious&quot; to create a fake medical kit, collect semen from the accused's apartment, and then give the swabs to the pathologist.</p> <p>He said &quot;a number of people must have put their heads together&quot; for the accused's accusation to have been true.</p> <p>Despite just a trace amount of semen found inside Gotingco's body, Raftery said it didn't matter if it was &quot;one sperm head, or 1001. There was sperm there, and it was his&quot;.&nbsp;</p> <p>There was no suggestion that Gotingco had been raped after she died, and therefore she must have been alive, Raftery said.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;I am accusing (the defendant) of some very serious crimes but I'm not accusing him of necrophilia,&quot; he said. &nbsp;</p> <p>Raftery finished his address by pointing to GPS evidence that showed the accused had spent the rest of the night going backwards and forwards between his garage and his apartment.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;Far from being what he claims, a quick three minutes, lots of stab wounds to make it look like a murder and then I go upstairs and have a rest and go to bed. He was very busy, because he had a number of things to do,&quot; Raftery said.&nbsp;</p> <p>That included tidying the garage, cleaning himself and disposing of the evidence.&nbsp;</p> <p>A knife was later found buried in the back garden and despite another fish filleting knife with blood on the sheath found in the kitchen, Raftery said, &quot;it doesn't actually matter&quot; which knife was used.&nbsp;</p> <p>He said Gotingco's stab wounds, some to her front and back, showed she was probably struggling at the time she was stabbed.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;This woman was very much alive when he raped her, he knew it. Those wounds were inflicted as a way to finish her off so she could never speak,&quot; Raftery closed.&nbsp;</p> <p>The court room has remained packed for the final day of the trial, with Gotingco's family and friends attending for closing remarks.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>NURSE'S TESTIMONY</b></p> <p>Earlier, the murder accused rehired his lawyers for what is likely to be the last day of the trial.&nbsp;</p> <p>Chris Wilkinson-Smith and Kevin Brosnahan were appointed court amicus instead but on Thursday Justice Timothy Brewer told the jury of 12 that the defendant had chosen to rehire his lawyers after legal aid was approved.&nbsp;</p> <p>On Thursday morning the defence team called their last witness, a nurse who visited the accused while he was in prison last year.&nbsp;</p> <p>Her name and place of work is suppressed.&nbsp;</p> <p>She testified that the accused had told her was &quot;coming down&quot; after being a daily user of methamphetamine and cannabis.&nbsp;</p> <p>Despite claiming to be a drug addict who was high at the time of Gotingco's death, crown prosecutor Kieran Raftery said there was no evidence of drugs or drug paraphernalia being in his car or his apartment.&nbsp;</p>\",\n            \"images\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": 11816876,\n                    \"datetime_iso8601\": \"20150521T155504+1200\",\n

<p>English described the cash as an &quot;equity injection&quot; although the Government already owns 100 per cent of the state owned enterprise. While he said the use of the fund was &quot;appropriate&quot; he signalled Kiwirail would have to take steps to eliminate the need for ongoing subsidy.</p> <p>&quot;We imagined three or four years ago that we wouldn't be putting, that KiwiRail wouldn't require so much ongoing investment. As we have said here...that level of government contribution is unsustainable at $200m per year to keep the operation going.&quot;</p> <p>Already announced, the Budget also confirms that another $210m will be invested in the ultra fast broadband network, as well as $97m for regional highways and 440m towards regional cycleways.</p> <p>New projects announced on Thursday include $52m for a total rebuild of the Waitangi Wharf in the Chatham Islands.</p> <p>&quot;The wharf is the only cargo-handling facility for essential supplies, including diesel for the electricity grid and fuel for air services,&quot; Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne said.</p> <p>&quot;The existing wharf is a structural risk and needs to be replaced within five years.&quot;</p> <p>Other projects winning funding include $40m for capital investment at Te Papa on its Wellington buildings and $13m to relocate Archives New Zealand's Christchurch regional office.</p> <p>Following the spending, around $726m is left in the fund, although $190m of this has already been earmarked for KiwiRail. The fund is expected to be completely exhausted in the 2016 Budget.</p> <p>Elsewhere biosecurity funding will be boosted by $24.9m over the next four years, including for additional x-ray machines for screening the increasing number of passengers entering New Zealand.</p> <p>A further $4.7m will be spent over four years on more customs officials, this time for passengers leaving the country, in a bid to maintain New Zealand's low risk security status.</p> <p>Both measures, and much of the cost of the existing border programmes, will be covered from a new $100m tax on international travel.</p> <p>In housing, a new $52.2m contingency fund has been established to help facilitate building on Crown-owned land in Auckland, which would sold off after construction, including a &quot;portion&quot; of affordable housing.</p> <p>&quot;Our aim is to have a signed development agreement for the first land parcel within six months.&quot;</p> <p>Revenue Minister Todd McClay has announced new plans to write off large amounts of child support debt in a bid to recover more of the payments owed to the Crown.</p> <p>Currently child support debt is $3.2b and rising, and only $700m of that is actual child support, with the rest penalties for late payments. More than $800m is owed by people living in Australia.</p> <p>McClay said over the next four years around $1.7b of the debt wold be forgiven &quot;to encourage more support to reach children&quot;.</p> <p>&quot;Liable parents are facing paralysing levels of debt from penalties, and as a result are not attempting to pay their outstanding amount, nor are they meeting their current obligations.&quot;</p> <p>Inland Revenue would &quot;adopt a 'fair and reasonable' test to consider applying penalty relief where it makes sense to do so&quot;.</p> <p>Other changes are being made to cut the amount IRD charges in future penalties, from 10 per cent immediately, to 2 per cent immediately and a further 8 per cent on payments which are more than seven days late.</p>\",\n

increase in abuse from players.</p> <p>This week Central Football's eastern operations manager Phil Holt announced all clubs would be subject to a good behaviour bond in an attempt to stamp out ugly incidents involving officials in the beautiful game.&nbsp;</p> <p>The move could see Central Football clubs - from Taranaki to Manawatu and the Hawke's Bay - hit with a $1000 fine if they received a second match report citing persistent questioning of match officials, surrounding of the referee and unruly behaviour by teams.</p> <p>&quot;It's right across our Federation, it's not just the one area,&quot; Holt said.</p> <p>&quot;It's just a general thing because we've been receiving reports from refs about the constant snipping by snide comments by players about the ref and their decision making.&quot;</p> <p>The measure has been met with approval from Taranaki clubs.</p> <p>&quot;The point is we are having that much referee abuse of late that we will end up with no referees if this continues,&quot; Holt said.</p> <p>Top level Taranaki referee Andy McGechan said the bond was a very good idea as there was a huge problem recruiting and retaining officials.</p> <p>&quot;A lot of that is because the young people that we try to encourage to take up the whistle find it a little bit too daunting at times because of the descent and the back chat and the abuse from players and parents on the sideline,&quot; he said.</p> <p>McGechan said he had issued two yellow cards at secondary school matches this week due to back chat.</p> <p>&quot;It happens all of the time.&quot;</p> <p>Holt said while it wasn't a major problem he agreed it was taking its toll on some of the younger match officials, especially females.</p> <p>&quot;There probably has been a few more incidents of it this season, in the past years it hasn't been quite as bad.</p> <p>&quot;We are talking about young refs, teenagers, who we are trying to bring into the game. It's easy for them to be put off.&quot;</p> <p>Holt said he knew one referee who was reconsidering their future in the sport.</p> <p>It was the first time an across the board good behaviour bond had been imposed in the region.</p> <p>Every case would be judged on merit and the organisation would investigate any bad behaviour before action was taken.</p> <p>&quot;I'm sure that these clubs will get this message through to their players - if you do step out of line this is what we are going to get.&quot;</p> <p>New Plymouth Rangers Football Club president Monty Ammundsen said he agreed with the move and the consequences of breaking the bond would be emphasised to players.</p> <p>&quot;I think it's necessary, some club teams need to have a good look at their behaviour on the field,&quot; Ammundsen said.</p> <p>&quot;Some of the stuff that goes on is really unacceptable.&quot;</p> <p>Moturoa Associated Football Club president Stephen Frowde said although the club didn't condone bad behaviour he hadn't come across any this season.</p> <p>Frowde said the sport needed good referees but he believed $1000 was a &quot;massive amount&quot; of money for any club.</p> <p>&quot;They certainly need to do something if that kind of conduct is happening but I don't think penalising clubs financially is a positive way of doing it,&quot; he said.</p> <p>&quot;A club like us wouldn't be able to afford that sort of fine.&quot;</p> \",\n            \"images\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": 11816818,\n                    \"datetime_iso8601\":

streets and properties in Redcliffs, Christchurch on Wednesday.</p> <p>Emergency and city services pumped thousands of litres of&nbsp;water from the estuary side of Main Rd, after a mill used by Fulton Hogan&nbsp;to lay a new road gouged a mains pipe near the Redcliffs Shops about 11.30am.</p> <p>Some residents had water flowing into their garages and through their properties to the sea on the other side.</p> <p>Firefighters from Woolston and Sumner helped pump water away from the properties.</p> <p>A Fulton Hogan worker at the scene said roadworkers had not expected the underground&nbsp;pipe to extend as far as it did.</p> <p>Stephen Kimber, who is uninsured, feared his house would &quot;smell like a toilet&quot; once&nbsp;the water was gone.</p> <p>The resulting silt would leave his house damp, he said.</p> <p>&quot;But I know if I put the heat on to try and warm the place up, it'll start to smell like a toilet.&quot;</p> <p>Redcliffs resident Phillipa Foulds returned&nbsp;from orchestra practice at noon&nbsp;to discover water lapping near her garage and flowing through neighbouring houses.</p> <p>She said a roadworker had explained to her that the miller was &quot;absolutely brutal on anything it hits&quot;.</p> <p>Foulds was unfazed by the moat outside.</p> <p>&quot;Oh, we're used to flooding,&quot; she said.</p> <p>&quot;This is nothing.&quot;</p> <p>The majority of the water had been pumped away by 1pm.&nbsp;</p> <p>A Christchurch City Council spokeswoman said at 2pm said no one was without water.&nbsp;</p> <div> <span>&nbsp;</span>

world's fattest-ever burger - a 1080-calorie&nbsp;burger that it hopes appeals to Americans' patriotic spirit, along with their appetites.</p> <p>Carl's Jr's&nbsp;<i>The Most American Thickburger&nbsp;</i>features&nbsp;a beef patty topped with hot dogs and a layer of potato crisps, combining three&nbsp;barbecue staples in a creation aimed squarely at the fast-food chain's core customers: &quot;young, hungry guys&quot;.</p> <p>It has more than double the calories of a McDonald's Big Mac.</p> <p>&quot;People love these big, juicy, indulgent burgers,&quot; said Andy Puzder, the chief executive officer of closely held CKE Restaurants, the parent company of Carl's Jr. &quot;We know who we are and we know how to appeal to our customers.&quot;</p> <p>The idea for the burger has been percolating inside the California-based company for almost five years, Puzder said. The chain toyed with including french fries on the burger, but found they wouldn't hold up against the moisture inside the sandwich. They got too soggy. The same was true of regular potato chips, so Carl's Jr settled on kettle-cooked chips that are a bit hardier.</p> <p><img src=\\\"http://static.stuff.co.nz/1432178742/504/11816504.jpg\\\" /></p> <p>The fast-food chain, which is controlled by the private-equity firm Roark Capital, has about 3500 restaurants worldwide, including locations in New Zealand.</p> <p>As part of its strategy of going after 18- to 34-year-old men, the <a href=\\\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/videos/9023988/Carls-Jr-ads-Too-much\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">company's ads feature scantily clad models and actresses</a>, including Paris Hilton, Kim Kardashian and Charlotte McKinney. The new commercials for the American burger star <i>Sports Illustrated</i> swimsuit model Samantha Hoopes, who appears in a hot tub wearing an American flag bikini.</p> <p>&quot;It really emphasises the all-American nature of this burger and the taste sensation when you bite into it,&quot; Puzder said.</p> <p><b>Complaints drive sales</b></p> <p>The 64-year-old CEO said he has killed previous ads that he found too suggestive. He also shows each one to his wife before giving the green&nbsp;light. The commercials generate some complaints, but the attention - whether good or bad - ultimately helps the brand, Puzder said.</p> <p>&quot;Beautiful women eating burgers and washing cars - what could be more American than that? I'm OK with it,&quot; he said. &quot;We don't want to offend anyone, but the complaints seem to drive sales.&quot;</p> <p>Carl's Jr's best performing restaurant over the last two years is in Williston, North Dakota, where sales topped $US4 million ($5.5m) in 2014, almost four times the national average. Puzder attributed the performance to the male workers who have swarmed North Dakota looking for jobs in the oil and gas industry.</p> <p><b>Nutritional concerns</b></p> <p>And what about health concerns? With McDonald's dabbling with kale, consumers&nbsp;are probably more focused on nutrition than ever before. Do they really want a burger topped with chips and hot dogs that packs 64 grams of fat, almost three times as much as a Big Mac?</p> <p>Yes, Puzder said. Carl's Jr offers turkey burgers and has an all-natural patty made with beef raised without antibiotics, but those items don't sell as well as the more indulgent burgers.</p> <p>&quot;I'm not the food police,&quot; Puzder said. &quot;My job isn't to dictate to people what to eat. My job is to figure out what people want and sell it to them.&quot;</p>\",\n            \"images\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": 11816770,\n

The Budget also adds to the costs of international travel with a new border arrival and departure tax.</p> <p>English said the Government books were healthy and allowances for more spending remained unchanged, at $1b more in each of the next couple of years. That rises to $2.5b in 2017, an election year.</p> <p>&quot;The higher allowance in 2017 provides options for modest income tax reductions should fiscal and economic conditions allow,&quot; English said in his Budget speech.</p> <p>English said the $2.5b would provide for &quot;moderate&quot; tax cuts, but if economic conditions were worse than expected they could still run a surplus.</p> <p>Despite a growing economy, low inflation meant tax revenue was not rising as fast as earlier expected.</p> <p>The government is expecting &quot;sustained solid growth&quot; averaging just under 3 per cent in the next three years.</p> <p>&quot;Growth matters for jobs and wages,&quot; English said, with Treasury forecasting the average wage to rise by $7000 a year to $63,000 a year by 2019.</p> <p>Despite unemployment remaining stubbornly high at 5.8 per cent recently, the Government is forecasting that to drop to 5.1 per cent by March next year and eventually to 4.5 per cent by 2019.</p> <p>That would see an extra 150,000 jobs by the middle of 2019.</p> <p>In 2011, Treasury forecast jobs growth of 170,000 by the middle of this year and that had already been achieved, with three months to go, English said.</p> <p>Economic growth of 3.1 per cent is forecast for the year to March 2016, supported by the present migration boom, low interest rates and building work. The summer drought was expected to have had a small impact on growth in the first half of this year, 2015.</p> <p>But growth is expected to cool down as the high migration slows down, construction work cools and interest rates start to rise. Government spending was also expected to stay &quot;subdued&quot; and the high dollar would also act as a headwind for the economy, too.</p> <p>Lower dairy prices are also expected to slow growth.</p> <p>The Government, as already flagged, is cutting ACC levies, giving back $375m to taxpayers in 2016. The levy cuts, a de facto tax cut, follow reductions that have totalled $1.5b since 2012.</p> <p>The average car levy could drop to about $120 next year, about a third of current levels.</p> <p>Dropping the KiwiSaver kickstart payment for new enrolments will save the Government about $500m over four years. &nbsp;At about $125m a year that is almost equal to the expected Budget surplus next year.</p> <p>The kickstart payment was brought in when the KiwiSaver scheme was new, but English said it was no longer needed, given the success of the scheme.</p> <p>The Government was also raking in more cash from foreign tourists and Kiwi travellers with a &quot;border clearance levy&quot; that will raise about $100m a year.</p> <p>While the Government was giving back to taxpayers through lower ACC levies and has flagged possible income tax cuts in 2017, English said any further headroom would be used to cut Government debt faster.</p> <p>Net debt was expected to peak at 26 per cent of GDP before falling, dropping below 20 per cent of GDP by 2020.</p> <p>New Zealand was returning to surpluses earlier than most comparable countries and would have much lower debt levels than others in the OECD.</p> <p><b>Key economic assumptions:</b></p> <p>Migration falls from 56,600 a year in the middle of this year to 12,000 a year by mid-2017</p> <p>Oil assumed to rise to US$78 a barrel by 2019</p> <p>Dairy prices are expected to recover at a modest rate, returning to about US$3900 a tonne by the end of 2016</p> <p>Short term wholesale interest rates to stay steady at 3.6 per cent until the end of 2016 before rising to 4.9 per cent in 2019</p>\",\n            \"images\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": 11816830,\n                    \"datetime_iso8601\":

surprise move, English's seventh Budget tackles hardship among the poorest households. There is a package including $790 million over four years to boost welfare payments for beneficiaries with children and low income parents receiving Working for Families payments.</p> <p>There is a sting in the tail of the increases for beneficiaries though, as well as a new tax on travel and the abolition of a popular subsidy on saving.</p> <p>The Budget, and its focus on lower incomes, appears aimed squarly at clearing the path for future tax cuts.</p> <p>A cut in income taxes is slated as a fiscal priority for the first time, starting in 2017, likely to coincide with the next election.</p> <p>Families on benefits with children will get another $25 a week - $1300 a year. It will be the first time since 1972 that payments have been increased by more than inflation.</p> <p>Working for Families payments will also be increased for low and middle income families by up to $12.50 a week, although households earning $88,000 or above will see a small cut. The changes come into effect on April 1, 2016.</p> <p>In a statement, Prime Minister John Key said that providing support for children in hardship was a priority. The increases announced in the Budget &quot;will make a real difference by allowing parents to better provide for their children&quot;, Key said.</p> <p>English said the increases were balanced to not undermine the incentive to work while &quot;address[ing] our concern about children whose family's resources have been falling behind other households&quot;.</p> <p>Sole parents will now have to be &quot;work ready&quot; when their youngest child turns three (down from five years old), and the hours they are expected to work rises from 15 to 20 hours.</p> <p>Potential savers will foot much of the cost of the package. By the time you read this, the $1000 &quot;kickstart&quot; to join KiwiSaver has already been abolished.</p> <p>Travellers will also be stung with a new international departure levy to help cover the costs of new biosecurity measures.</p> <p>Although the exact structure of the levy is yet to be determined, it is expected raise $100m a year, adding $16 to the cost of flying to New Zealand and $6 to departing.</p> <p>Key, the Minister of Tourism, has previously lobbied against similar - albeit larger - taxes in countries such as the United Kingdom.</p> <p>Thursday's Budget revealed, once again, that the Government has abandoned attempts to reach surplus this year, with Treasury forecasting a deficit of $684m. Next year's predicted surplus is a wafer thin $176m.</p> <p>Since the forecasts were prepared, dairy prices have continued to slide.</p> <p><b>KEY POINTS</b></p> <p>-$790 million over four years for increased welfare payments and higher Working for Families payments in return for greater work obligations</p> <p>-No surplus, and next year's forecast surplus is within the margin of error</p> <p>-An immediate end to the $1000 Kiwisaver kickstart payment</p> <p>-A new $100 million tax on international travel to cover the cost of border protection and customs activities.</p>\",\n            \"images\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": 11816260,\n                    \"datetime_iso8601\": \"20150521T150529+1200\",\n                    \"datetime_display\": \"15:05 21/05/2015\",\n                    \"creditline\": null,\n                    \"caption\": \"Finance minister Bill English announcing his 'Hardship' budget.\",\n                    \"variants\": [\n                        {\n                            \"id\": 11816260,\n                            \"layout\": \"Small Thumbnail\",\n                            \"src\": \"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1432177529/260/11816260.jpg\",\n                            \"media_type\": \"Photo\",\n                            \"width\": \"90\",\n                            \"height\": \"60\"\n                        }\n                    ]\n                },\n                {\n                    \"id\": 11816261,\n                    \"datetime_iso8601\": \"20150521T150529+1200\",\n                    \"datetime_display\": \"15:05 21/05/2015\",\n                    \"creditline\": \"Ross Giblin\",\n                    \"source_code\": \"fairfax-media\",\n                    \"source_name\": \"Fairfax Media\",\n                    \"caption\": \"Budget defcon 2015\",\n                    \"variants\": [\n                        {\n                            \"id\": 11816261,\n                            \"layout\": \"Small Thumbnail\",\n                            \"src\": \"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1432177529/261/11816261.jpg\",\n                            \"media_type\": \"Photo\",\n                            \"width\": \"90\",\n                            \"height\": \"60\"\n                        }\n                    ]\n                },\n                {\n                    \"id\": 11816262,\n                    \"datetime_iso8601\": \"20150521T150529+1200\",\n                    \"datetime_display\": \"15:05 21/05/2015\",\n                    \"creditline\": \"Ross Giblin\",\n                    \"source_code\": \"fairfax-media\",\n                    \"source_name\": \"Fairfax Media\",\n                    \"caption\": \"Budget defcon 2015\",\n                    \"variants\": [\n                        {\n                            \"id\": 11816262,\n                            \"layout\": \"Strap Image\",\n                            \"src\": \"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1432177529/262/11816262.jpg\",\n                            \"media_type\": \"Photo\",\n                            \"width\": \"300\",\n                            \"height\": \"199\"\n                        },\n                        {\n                            \"id\": 11816263,\n                            \"layout\": \"Small Thumbnail\",\n                            \"src\": \"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1432177529/263/11816263.jpg\",\n                            \"media_type\": \"Photo\",\n                            \"width\": \"90\",\n                            \"height\": \"60\"\n                        }\n                    ]\n                },\n                {\n                    \"id\": 11816264,\n                    \"datetime_iso8601\": \"20150521T150529+1200\",\n                    \"datetime_display\": \"15:05 21/05/2015\",\n                    \"creditline\": \"Getty-Images\",\n                    \"caption\": \"It's the biggest day of the year for Finance Minister Bill English.

and was designed to get those who otherwise wouldn't pay to do so.</p> <p>New Zealand's child support debt is $3.2b, however only $700 million of this is what was originally child support.</p> <p>&quot;The rest is debt from penalties. This is the legacy of a penalty system that was overly punitive and which is now being changed,&quot; McClay said.</p> <p>&quot;We want liable parents to pay what they owe. To make that happen, Inland Revenue will adopt a 'fair and reasonable' test to consider applying penalty relief where it makes sense to do so.&quot;</p> <p>Much of the debt is owed by those on low incomes; according to McClay almost 54,000 of the 120,000 people with child support debt earn less than $30,000 annually. Collectively, this group owes more than $700m.</p> <p>&quot;This is in no one's interests. We want child support paid so it goes directly to the children who need it, or back to the taxpayers who are paying it by default in the form of a benefit to that child's family.&quot;</p> <p><b>READ MORE:&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/67168025/Thats-over-half-my-income-Parents-frustrated-by-child-support-formula-change\\\">&quot;That's over half my income&quot;</a></b></p> <p>Around $827 million of the total debt is owed by those living in Australia, mostly in the form of penalties. A further $778m, 84 per cent of which is penalties, is owed by those living elsewhere.</p> <p>&quot;We need to get parents to start paying so that children, many of whom are in hardship, are better off. Liable parents are facing paralysing levels of debt from penalties, and as a result are not attempting to pay their outstanding amount, nor are they meeting their current obligations.&quot;</p> <p>The growth of child support debt is expected to slow through reforms including cutting penalty rates from the current 10 per cent immediate penalty, to 2 per cent once the debt is overdue and a further 8 per cent if the amount remains unpaid after seven days.</p> <p>Monthly incremental penalties will be cut from 2 per cent to 1 per cent.</p> <p>&quot;These measures should not be seen as a soft option,&quot; McClay said.</p> <p>&quot;We remain focused on liable parents meeting the obligations to their children and will have no tolerance for parents who deliberately avoid responsibility.</p> <p>The write-off will not create a huge hole in the government's books, with $1.6b of the debt already reflected as an impairment on the books. According to McClay, the move will decrease Crown operating revenue by $47.1m over four years.</p> <p>The changes will take affect from April 2016.</p>\",\n            \"images\": [\n

intermediate school principal David Latimer has been jailed for possessing thousands of objectionable images involving child abuse &quot;of the highest level&quot; that he had downloaded on his school computer.</p> <p>He was jailed for 16 months when he appeared at Auckland District Court for sentencing on Thursday.</p> <p>Latimer, a former principal of Rangeview Intermediate in West Auckland, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to possession of objectionable images. At that appearance, his previous name suppression was lifted.</p> <p>The objectionable images found in his possession included rape, torture, bestiality and sex acts between adults and children and between children and children. The images included children as young as two or three, although the &quot;emphasis&quot; appeared to be on children aged 9-13, the Crown said - the age range of the children in his care at school.</p> <p>At least 16 images were found depicting bestiality with children.</p> <p>The images were found during the execution of a search warrant at the school in December 2013.</p> <p>The images were stored on &quot;a significant number&quot; of CDs, which were zipped and password protected. Some of the files were categorised and named, for example, &quot;Best of <g class=\\\"gr_ gr_44 gr-alert gr_gramm Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep\\\" data-gr-id=\\\"44\\\"> 2013&quot;, </g> while many pictures had been captioned by Latimer with what Judge Nicola Mathers called &quot;very disturbing captions&quot;.</p> <p>Among the images on his files were three photos taken during a school camp.</p> <p>The Crown estimated the CDs contained 77,000 images, although Latimer's defence lawyer Simon Lance said many of those images were in fact adult pornography.</p> <p>In sentencing, Judge Mathers said the offending &quot;made appalling reading&quot;.</p> <p>Although Latimer qualified for home detention, she said he needed to serve prison time as a more significant punishment.</p> <p>Latimer resigned from the Te Atatu South school in early 2014 after six years as principal.</p> <p>In court, Lance said Latimer was &quot;very remorseful&quot; and had self-referred to rehabilitation programmes.</p> <p>&quot;He's motivated to change and learn and to rehabilitate himself,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Latimer's wife had stuck by him, Lance said, and she and their children were in court to support the former principal.</p> <p>The Department of Internal Affairs has also confirmed it is investigating Latimer, although they would not say what for.</p> <p>Denise Ritchie, of&nbsp;child advocacy group&nbsp;Stop Demand Foundation, said the 16-month sentence was appropriate.</p> <p>&quot;It reflects the gravity of Latimer's crimes, which involved countless child victims, it serves as a deterrent to others, and it signals that New Zealand takes seriously the need to crack down hard on anyone caught fuelling the demand for such material,&quot; Ritchie said.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;Without market demand by predators like Latimer, there would be no supply.</p> <p>&quot;The cumulative impact on the countless children harmed in Latimer's collection cannot be overstated.&quot;</p> <p>Waitakere Area Principal's Association president Martyn Weatherill said the association expressed its &quot;abhorrence&quot; towards Latimer's actions.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;We take solace in the assurances provided by representatives of the Ministry of Education and the board of trustees that employed Mr Latimer at the time of these offences, that the crimes for which Mr Latimer has been convicted did not involve any of the students at the school.&quot;<br /> </p> <p>The association wanted to acknowledge the investigative work of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;It is reassuring to know that when this type of offending, which goes far beyond the technical or financial resources of a school to detect, that the Department of Internal Affairs is able to provide such an effective backstop.<br /> </p> <p>&quot;We note that the school's board of trustees has recently appointed a new principal and that the school is in good heart, as they seek to put these events firmly behind them.&quot;</p>\",\n            \"images\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": 11815865,\n                    \"datetime_iso8601\":

<p>Available rooms during the National Agricultural Fieldays, which run June 10-13, are always scarce as tens of thousands of visitors linked to the farming sector look for a bed. But extra pressure has been piled on by the Fifa U-20s football matches, which start on May 30 and overlap the event with six matches, including a quarter final on June 14.</p> <p>Hamilton's i-SITE website shows that three of 57 accommodation providers listed have space on June 11, the day of the first round of Fifa playoffs.</p> <p>A two-bedroom family apartment at Cedar Lodge Motel - &nbsp;the last space available - was going for $440, or $300 above the winter rate. The room was snapped up by 1pm Wednesday.</p> <p>Bed and breakfast at Abbots Hamilton would normally cost $99 a night for two, but Fieldays weekend, you'll pay $369. &nbsp;</p> <p>Neither the Cedar Lodge Motel or Abbots Hamilton could not be contacted for comment.</p> <p>Motel Six and The Narrows Landing Hotel confirmed over the phone that they were fully booked for Fieldays, and had been for quite some time but could not offer any price ranges that were being paid for that period.</p> <p>Waikato Motel Association president and Ulster Lodge Motel owner Narinder Sagoo said increased prices during high-profile events was normal practice worldwide. His rooms started around the $250 mark for the football-Fieldays week.</p> <p>&quot;In any demand-type of business, like if you're flying in peak times, there are different rates that apply. I wouldn't want anyone to be overcharging, but it is nothing untoward.&quot;</p> <p>He said Fieldays' visitors tended to book rooms a year ahead.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;What generally happens is people who came last year rebook in the same place. There is always a shortage of accommodation.&quot;</p> <p>But ironically, people can also get a room for free.&nbsp;</p> <p>Hamilton City Council has stepped in with a Home Host programme, where people can be billeted in pre-arranged homes for free. Co-ordinator Andrea Fitness said the scheme was aimed to ensure everyone was accommodated.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;We've only launched this programme 10 days ago, but we've had about a dozen expressions of interest so far. We absolutely welcome more. It offers a different experience, a Kiwi and Hamilton experience.&quot;</p> <p>Due to the nature of the playoffs, visitors will be looking for a place to stay at the last minute.</p> <p>&quot;So our hosts are just on standby, really, at the moment. And we are suggesting a donation [for the hosts] along the lines of a koha.&quot;</p> <p>She said the thank you gesture could be in the form of tickets to a game or a meal in one of Hamilton's restaurants.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sagoo&nbsp;said he liked the Home Hosts programme, but didn't think there would be a massive need for it.</p> <p>&quot;It's not like the Cricket World Cup, where people are committed to staying in one area the whole day. It's quite conceivable for people to drive into the city from Auckland or Bay of Plenty for a game, and then drive out again.&quot;</p> <p>For details on the Home Host programme,

They were also asked to provide next-of-kin contact details, so al Qaeda could inform relatives once the mission had been carried out.<br /> <br /> The <a href=\\\"http://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ubl/english/Instructions%20to%20Applicants.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">application form, created by &quot;The Security Committee –&nbsp;al Qaeda Organisation&quot;</a>, must be filled out &quot;accurately and truthfully&quot; and written &quot;clearly and legibly,&quot; the form said.</p> <p>Answers should be in Arabic, but that was not essential.</p> <p>&quot;If you would like to discuss any further issue, please tell your direct brother supervisor,&quot; the form states.</p> <p>Candidates must then state their name, age, alias, profession and marital status –&nbsp;plus &quot;date of your arrival in the land of Jihad&quot;. Education level must be stated, along with the date when &quot;Allah blessed you with this gift&quot;.<br /> <br /> The al Qaeda chiefs evidently appreciated learned recruits: they were asked to list their favourite Muslim scholars and orators, their language skills, and how much of the Koran they had memorised. Knowledge of Sharia law was also a bonus.<br /> <br /> But the terrorist network was looking for well-rounded jihadists. &quot;Any hobbies or pastimes?&quot; the form asked, and requested a list of countries which the budding terrorist had visited. &quot;Have you invented or researched anything in any domain?&quot;<br /> <br /> Specialised skills would make a candidate highly sought-after. The form asks potential recruits to list any knowledge or friends with knowledge of chemistry, communications or literature.</p> <p>The next question is: &quot;What objectives would you like to accomplish on your jihad path?&quot; Recruits are asked to explain the views on jihad held by their family, acquaintances and themselves. And the final question seeks a name and telephone number.</p> <p>It asks: &quot;Who should we contact in case you became a martyr?&quot;</p>\",\n            \"images\": [\n                {\n

also dedicating $76.1m to help hospices expand palliative care services with 60 new nurse specialists and care educators.</p> <p>A further $98 million for more elective surgeries had already been announced ahead of Thursday's Budget.</p> <p>Health Minister Jonathan Coleman said the spend showed a &quot;commitment to supporting and growing&quot; health services.</p> <p>&quot;Despite our economic challenges, we have focused on delivering better, more convenient healthcare sooner.</p> <p>&quot;We have also streamlined health sector services to make each dollar go further,&quot; he said.</p> <p>The funds for Bowel Screening would extend the $24m pilot in New Zealand's largest DHB, which has been running since January 2012.</p> <p>&quot;The Government is considering the next steps for a national bowel screening programme.</p> <p>&quot;The largest constraint is having the workforce to do the colonoscopies and there are a number of initiatives under way to address this,&quot; Coleman said.</p> <p>More than 35,800 people received a colonoscopy last year, up from 29,000 in 2013. But bowel cancer remained one of New Zealand biggest killers.</p> <p>And as New Zealand's population continued to age, more investment was needed in caring for those who were terminally ill.</p> <p>&quot;In 2013, more than 15,000 people received care and support from hospice services throughout New Zealand, and hospice staff made more than 145,000 home visits.</p> <p>Just over 20 per cent of people requiring palliative care were under the age of 60.</p> <p>The funding for 60 new palliative care nurses would allow them to &quot;train, mentor and support&quot; staff across aged residential care, GP practices and home-based support services.</p>\",\n            \"images\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": 11816889,\n                    \"datetime_iso8601\":

and the devout gathered together in protest outside the Auckland High Court as a battle over school Bible lessons kicked off on Thursday morning.</p> <p>Jeff McClintock, the father of a student from Red Beach School in Auckland, is taking on his daughter's school and the attorney-general in a&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/66496504/Bible-lessons-lead-to-court\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">landmark case</a>.</p> <p>After numerous complaints to the school about his daughter Violet being placed back in school Bible classes without his permission, McClintock decided to bring his case against Red Beach School Board of Trustees for breaching its duties under the Education Act 1989 and against the attorney-general for passing legislation that was inconsistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights.</p> <p>McClintock is a member of the Secular Education Network (SEN), which had supported him and other parents and members of the community who were opposed to the current guidelines surrounding Bible classes in schools.</p> <p>SEN spokesman David Hines said the aim of the case was for all religion to be taught in schools, but not by &quot;christian missionaries&quot;.</p> <p>&quot;They (Bible classes) are bad news for anybody who is not a christian. They teach all our values come from Christianity, which annoys people. They teach you have to believe in God to be a good person...they don't mention Islam in any of their lessons.</p> <p>&quot;Muslims are joining our organisation because they want us to work with schools where their beliefs are taught. We want all religions taught in schools, not just Christianity.&quot;</p> <p>About a dozen protesters who opposed the current state of school Bible lessons regulations in New Zealand staged a demonstration outside the High Court at Auckland on Thursday morning before McClintock's case.</p> <p>They waved banners with phrases including &quot;maths not myths&quot; and &quot;education not indoctrination&quot;.</p> <p>The group of protesters included atheists who wanted no religion to be taught in state schools, as well as religious people who believed all religions – rather than only Christianity – should be taught as part of the school curriculum.</p> <p>The court hearing was a preliminary hearing to decide whether the Churches Education Commission (CEC) can give evidence about the Bible classes in the case. The substantive case is set down for October.</p> <p>CEC runs Bible classes in about 700 state primary schools nationwide, not including Red Beach School.</p> <p>The organisation's lawyer, Ian Bassett, told Justice Susan Thomas any ruling in favour of McClintock at a later hearing could have a &quot;chilling&quot; effect on any Board of Trustees when considering christian education programmes.</p> <p>This would have an obvious effect on CEC, which provided about 80 per cent of the classes in New Zealand, so they deserved to be represented as an interested party, he said.</p> <p>But McClintock's lawyer Richard Francois said the Crown Law Office was perfectly able to represent all views and allowing CEC to have its lawyers present would allow the opposition to &quot;gang up&quot; on his client.</p> <p>The judge reserved her decision.</p> <p>Outside court, McClintock told media there was obviously a worry from the church regarding the implications of a victory for himself.</p> <p>&quot;It's obvious from the amount of firepower being aimed at me that the churches are scared I'm going to win.&quot;</p> <p>Bible classes should be opt in and at the moment only one religion was getting the opportunity to come into schools and &quot;indoctrinate&quot; children.</p> <p>&quot;We've been talking to buddhists, we've been talking to hindu, sikh, muslim, jewish and atheist representatives who say if there's going to be religious education, let's talk about it all and give kids a balanced view of all religions.</p> <p>&quot;Just concentrating on one religion is giving a skewed perspective and it's not really fair on five year-old kids.&quot;</p> <p>Meanwhile, SEN had been in&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/66525117/bible-studies-concerns-heard-by-human-rights-commission\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">mediation with the Ministry of Education</a>&nbsp;through the Human Rights Commission.</p> <p>Hines said the outcome of the mediation sessions was expected early next month.</p> <p>The ideal outcome for SEN would be to have the system changed to &quot;opt in&quot; from &quot;opt out&quot;, so parents had to give permission for children to take part in the lessons.</p> <p>SEN also wanted the classes to be held before or after school, or during

&quot;refuel&quot;.</p> <p>Quenched, founded by friends&nbsp;David Loveridge, Tom Brown and Anika Rani, officially launched last week.</p> <p>The service was advertising with slogans including &quot;Delivering happiness&quot;. &nbsp;&quot;Need booze quick? We'll have it to your door in 45 minutes. Don't stop the party at your place early, we are here to help.&quot;</p> <p>It allowed people to buy wine, beer, cider, spirits and snacks online and get it delivered to an address in central Wellington with a delivery fee of just&nbsp;$5. If the order is more than $50, delivery is free.</p> <p>On Thursday, its website said: &quot;Hi, unfortunately we've decided to close the shop for now.&quot;</p> <p>However, it appears people can still log in if they have a password.</p> <p>The business has also changed its slogans on Twitter and Facebook. The summaries now read: &quot;Quenched is an innovative company powering convenient delivery of alcohol, snacks and other beverages&quot;.</p> <p>Loveridge, who talked freely about the business on Wednesday, could not be reached for comment.</p> <p>Dunedin School of Medicine professor Jennie Connor said it was very responsible of Quenched to shut down the website.</p> <p>&quot;Maybe they are rethinking if this whole thing is a good idea. Or maybe they are getting away from the public eye.</p> <p>&quot;I think they were just a bit naive.&quot;</p> <p>On Wednesday, Connor said the service was a very bad idea.</p> <p>&quot;This allows for intoxicated people at a party to make a decision, while intoxicated, to drink some more, and this is very unhealthy behaviour. It's making refuelling easier, and they are asking for trouble.&quot;</p> <p>New Zealand Medical Association chairman Stephen Child said he deplored any move that made it easier to access alcohol in a way that could lead to abuse.</p> <p>&quot;When you have slogans like 'Need liquor quicker?', it's hardly encouraging responsible consumption.&quot;</p> <p>He said the site had been marketing its service as an &quot;emergency response&quot;, which was completely inappropriate.</p> <p>&quot;Controls on [selling alcohol] are there for a purpose: &nbsp;to try and reduce alcohol-related harm. Making it easier to access works against this.&quot;</p> <p>Loveridge said on Wednesday that Quenched aimed to provide a convenient and fast service, not to encourage irresponsible drinking.</p> <p>&quot;Everything is legal, and we definitely don't want to encourage bad drinking.&quot;</p> <p>The delivery team checked buyers' identities on arrival, and would only hand over the order to the person who made it, he said.</p> <p>If the clients were underage or intoxicated, the order would not be delivered. Instead, the customers would receive a full refund.<span>That fee would be taken off the transaction value before the refund was provided.</span></p> <p>The service was being trialled in central Wellington, &nbsp;between Rongotai, Owhiro Bay, Karori and Kaiwharawhara. If successful, the partners wanted to branch out to other Wellington suburbs and had not ruled out setting up in other regions.</p> <p>Loveridge would not say how many staff they employed, the number of vehicles they used, or where their supplier was based. However, he said suppliers and customers had been very supportive.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;It's been quite good. We've been run off our feet, which is fantastic.&quot;</p>\",\n            \"images\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": 11815641,\n                    \"datetime_iso8601\":

<p>&quot;This is an incredible opportunity to build a new team from the ground up,&quot; Barker said from Bermuda where he and team general manager Kazuhiko &quot;Fuku&quot; Sofuku have been meeting with America's Cup officials.</p> <p>&quot;It's an honour to take on the responsibility of both CEO and skipper of SoftBank Team Japan.</p> <p>&quot;We're filling the key roles on the team as quickly as we can.

first America's Cup world series event in Portsmouth, England, in July.</p> <p>Barker's vast experience of 20 years in the game will be crucial both on and off the water.</p> <p>&quot;In the short term, our job is to be ready to compete in Portsmouth,&quot; said Fuku.</p> <p>&quot;Then, our focus will shift to trialling more Japanese sailors as we continue to build and develop our team.&quot;</p> <p>Barker was adamant he still had an effective role to play on the water in America's Cup racing after Team New Zealand tried to move him sideways into a coaching position as Peter Burling and Glenn Ashby were named to contest the helm for Team New Zealand's next challenge.</p> <p>The 43-year-old was touted as a likely inclusion when Team Japan announced their intentions, though his name was missing from their original confirmation of entry.</p> <p>The syndicate are backed by banker Masoyashi Son whose wealth is estimated to be US$22 billion (NZ$29b), making him Japan's wealthiest man.</p> <p>Barker has surely earned himself a lucrative contract though he will have to work hard to earn his money in a rookie syndicate.</p> <p>Japan have contested three America's Cups – in 1992, 1995 and 2000 – but have no history in the new multi-hull game.</p> <p>Barker brings plenty of knowledge with him to a syndicate who are desperate to be competitive.</p> <p>He built up an intimate knowledge of the secrets that have made Team New Zealand the most consistent team in modern America's Cup history.</p> <p>With the next Cup in 2017 being raced in smaller 48-foot foiling catamarans that feature several one-design elements in key area, there is an ability for teams to get up top speed more quickly.</p> <p>Cup holder Oracle have already offered a helping hand to the Japanese with some basic design information.</p> <p>Barker's inclusion with Team Japan continues New Zealand's strong links in cup racing with that country.</p> <p>Kiwi Chris Dickson skippered Japan's 1992 challenge in San Diego where they reached the semifinals of the Louis Vuitton Cup.</p> <p>At the 1995 regatta in San Diego, New Zealander John Cutler was at the helm of the Japanese challenge

Li Hejun?</p> <p>That's the question many were wondering when the founder, chairman and principle owner of Hanergy Thin Film Power Group failed to show up at his company's annual meeting Wednesday –&nbsp;the same day the company's stock price tanked 47 per cent, wiping out US$19 billion ($26 billion) in market value in 24 minutes.</p> <p>The entrepreneur, who began the day as China's second-richest man worth more than US$30 billion, was almost US$14 billion poorer by 11am, according to a Forbes magazine estimate.<br /> <br /> Li Hejun's absence at the shareholder meeting was all the more noteworthy because over the past year he has tirelessly championed his vision of a new era of mobile energy: thin, flexible solar cells. They would soon, he promised, be plastered on just about everything: cars, backpacks, phones, tents, satellites, flashlights, buildings, lamps, drones and clothing.<br /> <br /> Under his stewardship, the company's stock had surged more than sixfold in the past year, making it the world's most valuable solar company worth more than HK$300 billion (NZ$52.8 billion). That's larger than tech-giant Sony and seven times the size of First Solar, the biggest US solar manufacturer.</p> <p>Then on Wednesday, trading was suspended after the shares spectacularly plunged amid speculation of market manipulation and questions about the viability of the company's core technology - while the entrepreneur himself spent the morning at the opening of a clean energy exhibition in Beijing, according to a company spokesman.</p> <p>&quot;All directors of listed companies take part in setting the dates of their shareholder meetings, and they should attend,&quot; said David Webb, shareholder activist and founder of Webb-site.com.</p> <p>&quot;If a chairman of a mainland company did not show up in Hong Kong for the AGM, then it raises questions.&quot;</p> <h3>UNPROVEN TECHNOLOGY</h3> <p>&quot;The bulk of Hanergy's technology portfolio remains unproven,&quot; said Jenny Chase, lead solar industry analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance.</p> <p>In a six-page examination of the Hong Kong manufacturer's operations, the London-based researcher said it's been unable to find a detailed list of solar-power projects that would help explain why the company's shares surged in the past year.</p> <p>Technology aside, for months analysts and investors have raised questions about the company's revenue source: more than 60 per cent of Hanergy Thin Film's sales come from Beijing-based parent Hanergy Holding Group, a solar panel and hydroelectric company. And Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission has been probing market manipulation in Hanergy's shares for several weeks, according to a Reuters report. A spokesman for the regulator declined to comment.</p> <p>&quot;It's an adjustment that the market has been waiting for to happen, as Hanergy's earnings and business performance didn't support such a high stock price or valuation,&quot; said Gong Siwen, an analyst in China for Northeast Securities.</p> <p>An even more fundamental investor concern, though, is whether the company's technology actually works and how big the market for it would be.</p> <h3>AMBITIOUS PLANS</h3> <p>Li had big plans. Among them, Hanergy Thin Film has said it will begin commercially producing by October cars that will be totally powered by the sun. The vehicles would be able to drive 80 kilometres to 100 kilometres on a four-hour charge from six square metres of thin film. Yet the industry is full of examples of companies that have developed the kind of thin-film solar cells Hanergy is banking on, yet have ended up in bankruptcy.</p> <p>In an interview in March, Li called the company's investments cautious and said the earlier run-up in the stock was validation of the solar-maker's focus on a new era of mobile energy.</p> <p>No one would argue that the technology lacks promise. Because its thin-film cells can be flexible, they've found their way into applications such as the solar panels for satellites developed by NASA, backpacks and windows. Solar calculators were some of the first devices to use them. Mass production, however, has proven costly. One early flop: Solyndra went bankrupt in 2011 after getting US$528 million from the US government.</p> <p>Hanergy said in April it would build a factory to make the world's most efficient solar cells, using gallium arsenide that capture more energy from the sun. But experts cautioned that technology is years away from gaining mass appeal for the only solar market that really counts today: rooftop and utility-scale installations, an established US$24 billion market.</p> <h3>PIECEMEAL TECHNOLOGY</h3> <p>That left the company's fortunes entirely dependent on an as yet unproven technology which it has acquired piecemeal through acquisitions. Hanergy entered thin film through a buying spree. The first purchase was Solibro, a subsidiary of Germany's Q-Cells SE. That was followed by MiaSole, a California-based manufacturer, Global Solar Energy based in Arizona, and Alta Devices.</p> <p>It was the Alta purchase, completed in August 2014, that gave Hanergy a toehold in gallium arsenide. Hanergy vowed to use Alta's products in a broad range of consumer products such as mobile phones and in automobiles.</p> <p>&quot;The advantage is going to be where things have to be flexible and light,&quot; said Isik Kizilyalli, a former Alta senior scientist. &quot;I think that's where the value of what Alta will end up being until they can bring the price down,&quot; said Kizilyalli, who is the founder and chief technology officer at Avogy, an energy-efficiency electronics company.</p> <h3>CATERING TRUCKS</h3> <p>In April, Hanergy's Li unveiled partnerships to develop catering trucks and recreational vehicles that would draw on the solar-maker's panels for energy.</p> <p>The catering vehicles would generate 6 kilowatt-hours of electricity in normal sunlight for electronics such as light and refrigeration. The touring vehicle would use six 75-watt panels from MiaSole to generate 2 kilowatt-hours a day of electricity in normal light.</p> <p>BNEF's Chase wrote in a March report that she was &quot;skeptical that any thin-film technology unproven in bulk production will revolutionise the solar industry.</p> <p>&quot;While technological black swans can never be ruled out, the history of thin film has largely been one of losses and disappointments,&quot; she wrote.</p> <p>History may be proving her right.</p>\",\n            \"images\": [\n                {\n

Athfieldturned down three knighthoods before finally accepting one, just months before he died, his widow has revealed.</p> <p>Lady Clare Athfield, who accepted her husband's knighthood from Governor-General Sir Jerry Mateparae at Government House on Thursday, said he turned down the earlier offers because he was a humble man.</p> <p>&quot;But when he finally accepted, he started calling himself 'Sir Ath' and I had to stop saying to him, when I was in a bad mood, Sir Charles, would you mind?&quot; she laughed. His middle name was Charles.</p> <p>&quot;But he really should have been here to accept this,&quot; she said.</p> <p>Athfield died in Wellington Hospital in January, after complications from cancer surgery, but knew of his knighthood before he died.</p> <p>His widow was supported at the ceremony by their two sons, Zachary and Jesse, Zachary's wife Sarah, their children Tommy and Isla, as well as Athfield's brother, Tony, who all spoke of his great achievements.</p> <p>The ceremony brought back many memories for the family. &quot;It's very special and very emotional for all of us,&quot; Clare Athfield said.</p> <p>&quot;He's still with us everywhere, though, he hasn't gone away. He pops up in every tree, his spirit is everywhere, he is alive.&quot;</p> <p>He would live on forever in his art, she said. &quot;I don't think we've seen the end of it. What he and other creative people have achieved, it just grows with time. So we are all very lucky and very proud.&quot;</p> <p>Tony Athfield remembered a discussion about his brother's knighthood earlier this year: &quot;I asked him, how does Clare feel about being Lady Clare and he said 'She prefers to be Maid Clare'.</p> <p>&quot;He was a good brother. He was very much into architecture from a young age and he always supported me.&quot;</p> <p>Zachary Athfield said: &quot;He was a compassionate guy, a nice guy ... he started quite a lot of things that will carry on for a while, that will live on.&quot;</p> <p>In a professional career spanning half a century, his stamp was imprinted across Wellington, and with Roger Walker, he was probably New Zealand's leading exponent of modernist architecture.</p> <p>His best-known works included the Wellington City Library and its nikau palm columns, built as part of the Civic Square redevelopment in the 1980s; his own sprawling Khandallah house; the conservation of Government House; the Adam Art Gallery; and later the Clyde Quay Wharf apartments.</p> <p>He also designed Jade Stadium in Christchurch, which was da4maged in the February 2011 earthquake.</p> <p>His body of work included more than 150 projects and won him more than 60 awards.</p>\",\n            \"images\": [\n

2017</a></b></p> <p>Thursday's package is expected to affect about 110,000 families, with 190,000 children, living in the most severe hardship.</p> <p>But the Government has made it clear it expects more people working more hours, while it searches for ways to boost a lower-than-forecast tax revenue.</p> <p>Most significantly, sole parents on a benefit will be forced to return to part-time work two years earlier, when their child turns three.</p> <p>However, those parents would be eligible for increased childcare assistance.</p> <p>Increased work obligations would apply to all beneficiaries - the main changes include:</p> <p>* Most sole-parents, and partners of beneficiaries, will have to be available for part-time work once their youngest child turns three, rather than the current age of five.</p> <p>* All beneficiaries with part-time work obligations would be expected to find work for 20 hours a week, rather than current 15 hours.</p> <p>* Benefit rates for families with children will raise by $25 a week after tax - the first time since 1972 that core benefits rates have been increased by more than inflation.</p> <p>* Beneficiaries receiving Sole Parent Support will have to reapply for their benefit every year.</p> <p>* Low-income working families earning $36,350 a year or less, before tax, will get $12.50 extra a week from Working for Families.</p> <p>* Some very low-income working families will get $24.50 extra per week.</p> <p>* Higher income families earning more than $88,000 a year would get slightly less from Working for Families - losing about &nbsp;$3 a week from their pay packets.</p> <p>Social Development Minister Anne Tolley said she was confident the package would not contribute to further welfare dependency, but would have a &quot;positive impact&quot; on New Zealand's poorest families.</p> <p>&quot;While two-thirds of children in more severe material hardship live in beneficiary families, the remaining third have working parents on low incomes, and the Government thinks those families could also do with extra support,&quot; she said.</p> <p>The Government was expecting the package to have a &quot;meaningful impact&quot; on four different groups of families in New Zealand.</p> <p>They were beneficiary families, low and very low-income working families as well as well as families earning more than $36,350 a year.</p> <p><b>WHAT THIS MEANS FOR FAMILIES:</b></p> <p>* Low income families will be eligible for a higher rate of Childcare Assistance for pre-school and out-of-school care, with the rate increasing from $4 per hour to $5 per hour.</p> <p>* Working families earning less than $27,000 per year in gross income will get the full $12.50 a week extra, from the in-work tax credit, plus $12 a week from the minimum family tax credit - a total increase of $24.50 per week.</p> <p>* Other working families earning $36,350 or less a year will get the full $12.50 a week extra, from the rise to the in-work tax credit.</p> <p>* Working families earning more than $36,350 will get progressively smaller increases as their incomes get higher - a family earning $45,000, for example, would get an increase of $10.42 a week.</p> <p>* Some families will get less than they did before, from Working for Families, most of those being higher income earners on more than $88,000 a year.</p> <p>* Main benefit rates for all families with children will increase $25 per week. The main benefits are the Supported Living Payment, for people unable to work due to illness or disability; Sole Parent Support, for sole parents with children under 14, Jobseeker Support and the Emergency Benefit, for people in hardship who don't qualify for the other types of benefit.</p> <p>* About nine in 10 of those families are sole parent families. The increase amounts to an 8.3 per cent increase in most sole parents' base rate of benefit (currently $301 a week).</p> <p>*&nbsp; Student Allowance rates for families with children will also increase by $25 a week.</p> <p><b>THE CRITERIA:</b></p> <p>* Beneficiaries receiving sole parent support will have to reapply for the benefit every year. This is expected to affect about 70,000 sole parents.</p> <p>* Those on Jobseeker support already have to reapply for their benefits every year.</p> <p>* Benefit families who pay income-related rents for social housing will pay slightly more. Their rent is set at 25 per cent of their income, so with a $25-per-week boost their rent would rise by $6.25 a week.</p> <p>* From April 1, next year sole parents will be required to go into part-time work when their youngest child turns three.</p> <p>* Part-time work is now considered a minimum of 20 hours, rather than the current 15.&nbsp;</p>\",\n            \"images\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": 11816025,\n                    \"datetime_iso8601\": \"20150521T144542+1200\",\n                    \"datetime_display\": \"14:45 21/05/2015\",\n                    \"creditline\": \"Brad Calkins 123RF\",\n                    \"caption\": \"Stock Photo - Coin piles compound interest banking, coins, compound, interest, money, piles, save, savings, stacks generic\",\n                    \"variants\": [\n                        {\n                            \"id\": 11816025,\n                            \"layout\": \"Small Thumbnail\",\n                            \"src\": \"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1432176342/025/11816025.jpg\",\n                            \"media_type\": \"Photo\",\n                            \"width\": \"90\",\n                            \"height\": \"60\"\n                        }\n                    ]\n                },\n                {\n                    \"id\": 11816026,\n                    \"datetime_iso8601\": \"20150521T144542+1200\",\n                    \"datetime_display\": \"14:45 21/05/2015\",\n                    \"creditline\": \"Brad Calkins 123RF\",\n                    \"caption\": \"Stock Photo - Coin piles compound interest banking, coins, compound, interest, money, piles, save, savings, stacks generic\",\n                    \"variants\": [\n                        {\n                            \"id\": 11816026,\n                            \"layout\": \"Strap Image\",\n                            \"src\": \"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1432176342/026/11816026.jpg\",\n                            \"media_type\": \"Photo\",\n                            \"width\": \"300\",\n                            \"height\": \"200\"\n                        },\n                        {\n                            \"id\": 11816027,\n                            \"layout\": \"Small Thumbnail\",\n                            \"src\": \"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1432176342/027/11816027.jpg\",\n                            \"media_type\": \"Photo\",\n                            \"width\": \"90\",\n                            \"height\": \"60\"\n                        }\n                    ]\n                },\n                {\n                    \"id\": 11816028,\n                    \"datetime_iso8601\": \"20150521T144542+1200\",\n                    \"datetime_display\": \"14:45 21/05/2015\",\n                    \"creditline\": \"Brad Calkins 123RF\",\n                    \"caption\": \"Stock Photo - Coin piles compound interest banking, coins, compound, interest, money, piles, save, savings, stacks generic\",\n                    \"variants\": [\n                        {\n                            \"id\": 11816028,\n                            \"layout\": \"Defcon Image\",\n                            \"src\": \"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1432176342/028/11816028.jpg\",\n                            \"media_type\": \"Photo\",\n                            \"width\": \"418\",\n                            \"height\": \"220\"\n                        }\n                    ]\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": 68702774,\n            \"path\": \"/business/68702774/Budget-2015-Education-whats-in-it-for-schools\",\n            \"url\": \"http://www.stuff.co.nz/_json/business/68702774/Budget-2015-Education-whats-in-it-for-schools\",\n            \"section\": \"National\",\n            \"section-home\": \"Business\",\n            \"section-top-level\": \"Business\",\n            \"layout\": \"landscape-video\",\n            \"title\": \"Budget 2015: Education - what's in it for schools?

Gone but not forgotten.&nbsp;</p> <p>The books are forecast to be in deficit by $684m this year, improving to an anaemic surplus of $176m next year. That is well within the danger zone for English to report an eighth straight year in the red.</p> <p>And there are risks around that too.&nbsp;</p> <p>Dairy prices are softening and our main trading partners' growth is slowing.&nbsp;</p> <p>There is also an apparently heroic forecast of unemployment falling from 5.8 per cent now to less than 5 per cent during 2016 - even though growth slides from 3.3 per cent this year to under 3 per cent by the next election.</p> <p>The biggest disappointment, given the pre-Budget billing, was the slim $52.2m being made available &quot;to facilitate housing development on Crown-owned land in Auckland&quot;.&nbsp;</p> <p>For all the talk of swaths of government-owned land, it doesn't sound like a lot of land or a lot of houses at current Auckland

his priority.</p> <p>In a typically carrot and stick approach from National, Thursday's benefit increase is accompanied by much tougher work obligations for teen mums and jobless mums and dads, including a requirement to be ready for work once their youngest child turns three, not five as now.&nbsp;</p> <p>That will make it easier to sell among working families in middle New Zealand who will get proportionately less from working for families benefit increases.&nbsp;</p> <p>There will be some fallout over axing the KiwiSaver kickstart payment of $1000, but that will be limited by the fact that most eligible people have already signed up.</p> <p>Politically, this is one of the smartest Budgets yet from Key and English - and that is a high accolade for a Government that has consistently snookered its opponents by surprising on the upside with measures like last year's extension of free doctors' visits to children under 13.</p> <p>The biggest howls of outrage will more likely come from National's base and from the political right, rather than from the left.</p> <p>There will be concern in particular that after failing to hit its target of returning to surplus this year the target for next year looks just as marginal.</p> <p>Complaints about that will be muted for now especially with the prospect of tax cuts being dangled in front of voters for 2017 or 2018.</p> <p>But

electric railway through a tunnel to link Queenstown and Milford Sound.</p> <p>One town does not want an influx of tourists, while the other does not want tourists&nbsp;bypassing it.</p> <p>MSLR has <a href=\\\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/southland-times/68700168/new-milford-sound-to-queenstown-rail-plan-mooted\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">proposed to build a 15-kilometre vehicular drive-on-drive-off electric railway,</a>&nbsp;through a 13.5km tunnel between Milford Sound and Queenstown.</p> <p>It was the third such plan to shortcut the 287km road trip, with&nbsp;Conservation Minister Nick Smith <a href=\\\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/8930108/Government-axes-Milford-Tunnel\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">rejecting a&nbsp;$180 million plan</a> by Milford Dart to build a tunnel through

million monorail&nbsp;project</a>.</p> <p>Enviro Glenorchy, formally know as the Stop the Tunnel&nbsp;group, spokeswoman Trish Fraser said she believed Smith &quot;was clear he has shut the door&quot; on proposed plans in the area, &quot;but obviously not&quot;.</p> <p>Fraser&nbsp;said the group would be keeping the eye on the project and would be ready to fight it.</p> <p>In 2012 the group collected over <a href=\\\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/southland-times/news/7488204/Select-committee-for-anti-tunnel-petition\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">25,000 online signatures opposing</a> the Milford tunnel proposal which were accepted by the Local Government and Environment Select Committee.</p> <p>Fraser said the environmental impacts of the MSLR plan were unnecessary and the road from Queenstown to Glenorchy would not be able to cope with the extra traffic.</p> <p>&quot;That [the traffic impact] would be enormous. The road is already really busy with tourists,&quot; she said.</p> <p>She believed most of the town's residents would object to the proposal, as 98 per cent were against the Milford tunnel proposal.</p> <p>With foreign investors there were bound to be more schemes in the future, she said.</p> <p>However, &quot;it doesn't need to happen ... I would certainly be against it happening,&quot; she said.</p> <p>MSLR said it would run up to 12 train trips a day and each train would contain 10 single railroad low bed wagons, each capable of transporting a large tourist coach up to 12.6m and 20 tonnes in weight, and 10 regular flat bed wagons catering for up to 30 light vehicles.</p> <p>Annually, it could transport 700,000 passengers, over 3000 passengers a day</p> <p>Save Fiordland chairman Bill Jarvie, of Te Anau,&nbsp;said he believed the project would have similar environmental impacts as the failed Milford tunnel proposal.</p> <p>Jarvie, who said he was not outright opposed to development, said people travelling to the wilderness knew it took time and did not need to be rushed.</p> <p>&quot;The very thing people come to this country for (nature), they will effectively be ruining.&quot;</p> <p>If the project went ahead, it would have a negative impact on tourism in Te Anau community, he said.</p>\",\n

Commissioner John Edwards has urged.</p> <p>His comments come after Orcon was ordered to pay $25,000 to a Manawatu soldier following a dispute over a $208 bill.</p> <p>&quot;If there is a debt in dispute, companies have a very high duty to check they are not in error because there can be profound consequences for the individual if they get it wrong,&quot; Edwards said on Thursday.</p> <p>&quot;Here we had a soldier with a young family who was unable to gain rental accommodation as a result of this particular failure.&quot;</p> <p>Telecommunications company Orcon were ordered to pay the Manawatu man $25,000 in damages and train its staff on how to apply the Privacy Act on Wednesday.</p> <p>The Human Rights Review Tribunal, sitting in Palmerston North, found that Orcon should not have referred a disputed bill to collection agency Baycorp.</p> <p>The telco must pay customer Brett Taylor $10,000 for negatively affecting his good credit rating and $15,000 for humiliation, loss of dignity and injury to feelings.</p> <p>&quot;In view of the seemingly complete failure by Orcon to evidence an understanding of its obligations under the information privacy principles, it is our view a training order is necessary,&quot; said the tribunal.</p> <p>Defence force employee Taylor and his partner Chloe Tasker said the referral of the bill had affected their credit rating and prevented them and their 12-month-old daughter from finding accommodation.</p> <p>The dispute started when Taylor ordered the Genius Full broadband package and a landline.</p> <p>Orcon provided the wrong modem and connection was delayed while a replacement was requested.</p> <p>After the correct modem arrived neither the broadband nor the telephone worked, despite repeated calls to the Orcon support line.</p> <p>The couple immediately cancelled the account and said they were told by Orcon that no payment was due, but they kept receiving bills and the dispute continued.</p> <p>Orcon then sent the account to debt collector Baycorp.</p> <p>Taylor said the referral of the bill to the agency had caused him and his family considerable stress, including testing his relationship and career as well as affecting his credit history.</p> <p>&quot;As a young family, we need to be able to gain credit. My credit rating also affects my position in the army, and advancements in rank. I needed peace of mind that I would not have adverse credit for five years,&quot; Taylor told the tribunal.</p> <p>Tasker said they were also declined a debt consolidation loan.</p> <p>&quot;After that call, I was really emotional,&quot; she told the tribunal.</p> <p>The tribunal said it was remarkable that even when asked by its own debt collection agency to investigate the alleged debt, the telco did nothing.&nbsp;</p> <p>Orcon declined to comment.</p>\",\n            \"images\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": 11815126,\n                    \"datetime_iso8601\":

to the Mayor of the Rotorua Lakes Council is now undergoing forensic examination.</p> <p>Rotorua Lakes Council CEO&nbsp;Geoff Williams said at about 8:00am the envelope was opened by the call centre&nbsp;staff.</p> <p>The envelope was then quickly contained in a box and Police and Fire services were contacted.</p> <p>The building was then shut down and staff evacuated.</p> <p>Seven staff that came in contact with the envelope were decontaminated.</p> <p>&quot;This incident is being treated with serious concern although it has been suggested that it is&nbsp;unlikely&nbsp;to be hazardous material as if it was, it would have had an almost&nbsp;immediate effect,&quot; he said.</p> <p>&quot;This was quite a traumatic event for our staff. They are all fine and we are providing support, keeping in contact and following up with them.&quot;</p> <p>Mayor Steve Chadwick said this happening was out of the blue and the first incident to cause a heightened concern.</p> <p>&quot;It is very sad if there are people out there that feel so strongly. There are other ways to go about things,&quot; she said.</p> <p>&quot;I am feeling comforted in the work of Police and Fire services in that all the right things have been done.&quot;&nbsp;</p> <p>Police inspector Bruce Horne said the CIB are investigating the incident but it is still in its early stages.</p> <p>&quot;It is not known where the envelope has come from or what the substance is yet,&quot; he said.</p> <p>&quot;In 24 hours the forensic examination should be able to tell us if the powder is something to be concerned about. This will give those who were in contact with the substance peace of mind. It will take a bit longer to then find out exactly what the powder is.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The customer centre of the council will be open again this afternoon with the call centre potentially being closed until Monday with a team from Palmerston North taking phone calls until then.&nbsp;</p> <p>There is a team from Hamilton travelling to clean the Council building thoroughly so staff are then able to return to work.</p>\",\n            \"images\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": 11814670,\n                    \"datetime_iso8601\": \"20150521T124031+1200\",\n

Christchurch District Court today.</p> <p>Judge Jane Farish convicted and remanded him on bail for sentencing on July 8. She called for a pre-sentence report to cover his suitability for a home detention sentence but warned White that he might still be jailed.</p> <p>White's blackmailing led to him being ambushed, assaulted, and robbed by the victim's friends.</p> <p>White met the blackmail victim after the 18-year-old had advertised himself as a male escort. The two exchanged emails and photographs and then met. They only knew each other on a first-name basis but began an arrangement for commercial sexual services. They would meet once a month, or sometimes as often as twice a week.</p> <p>White paid $100 for sex, later increased to $150. The arrangement continued until the victim decided to quit the sex industry and distance himself from White. He moved away from Christchurch.</p> <p>White continued texting and became increasingly more demanding, eventually telling the victim that he would find out who he was and could make his life &quot;very unpleasant&quot; and &quot;miserable&quot;.</p> <p>He sent a text saying that he would start telling one person every day what he and the victim had done and how he had been supporting himself, unless he could meet him again for sex.</p> <p>He offered up to $15,000 for more sex and the complainant agreed. Police said he was struggling financially at the time.</p> <p>They met at an abandoned house in Christchurch when White told him the figure was $150. The victim declined to have sex. White drove off and sent texts mocking the victim.</p> <p>White continued to demand that the victim meet him for sex and said he still had photographs that the student had sent him. When the threats continued, the victim arranged to meet White in Blenheim for sex.</p> <p>The victim spoke to two friends and asked for their help. He said he wanted to give White a fright and take the cellphone that contained the photographs of the student. They planned an ambush.</p> <p>White drove to Blenheim, picked up the student and drove to a remote location where the friends were waiting. They assaulted White and took his phone. The victim and his friends were all charged with aggravated robbery and have been dealt with by the courts.</p> <p>The police also told the court of White contacting a 17-year-old male through Facebook. They met for coffee and White offered him money and a car to have sex with him. The complainant accepted a $10,000 offer for sex and they engaged in several sex acts.</p> <p>When interviewed by the police, White said he had a sex addiction and was receiving help. He said he did not pay the second victim because he was not going to pay for something that &quot;didn't work&quot;.</p>\",\n            \"images\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\":

\"<p>Wellington City Council is writing off tens of thousands of dollars each year because its tenants can't afford their rent.</p> <p>This year the council has written off nearly $70,000 of bad debt, and evicted 11 tenants.&nbsp;</p> <p>Officials said no formal records were kept of where those tenants went,&nbsp;but the council worked with other social housing providers to secure accommodation.</p> <p>&quot;We would not intentionally send someone out to survive on the street,&quot; city housing manager Vicki McLaren said.</p> <p>But the Salvation Army said many of its clients had faced eviction from either council or private rentals.</p> <p>&quot;It doesn't take much to get behind,&quot; community ministries secretary Pam Waugh said. &quot;There could be a high electricity bill, the car could break down, or a child gets sick, and then people are forced to make a decision. Is it rent or food this week?&quot;</p> <p>Wellington city councillor Paul Eagle said many of the council's 4000 or so tenants were living on the breadline, and were only a few dollars away from being homeless.</p> <p>&quot;Alarm bells should be ringing when something like a car or appliance repairs and urgent trips or expenses for family reasons could tip someone over the edge and into a debt spiral.</p> <p>&quot;If you look at the private sector and housing affordability, we have a real problem.</p> <p>&quot;Where do those tenants who fall behind in their rent or earn just above the council housing threshold go? The alternative options are few.&quot;</p> <p>The income threshold for a council property is $869 a week, after tax, for a single adult, and $1285&nbsp;for two adults and two children.</p> <p>The council subsidises rents so that tenants pay about 70 per cent of market rates. A three-bedroom council house in suburbs between Miramar and Karori costs between $252 and $390 a week.</p> <p>In the past four years, the council has written off more than $300,000, and almost 50 people have been forced out of their council flats or houses.</p> <p>City housing operations manager&nbsp;Carol Gould said debt was written off only when tenants had not paid up for more than 12 months, and collection efforts had failed.</p> <p>Bad debt is also written off if a tenant dies. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>A council spokesman said on Thursday that, in the context of about $20 million in annual revenue collected by City Housing, this year's bad-debt writeoff of about $67,000 was well below its 2 per cent target level. &quot;We actually see [it] as a pretty impressive achievement.&quot;</p> <p>City Housing operations are not funded from rates, but entirely from rental revenue.</p> <p>Each year, the council is also forced to chase up hundreds of thousands of dollars in rent. For the 2014-15 year to date, total tenant debt stands at $334,000.</p> <p>Tenants receiving benefits are encouraged to set up automatic payments for their rent, but cannot be forced to do so.</p> <p>The best outcome for the council was to find a way to get the rent paid and avoid an eviction, Gould said. &quot;We work hard to support tenants so this situation doesn't arise and is a last resort.&quot;</p> <p>The council has been upgrading its housing since 2008, with the help of a $220m government grant. It has spent $176m of that on completing upgrades to seven complexes, and will pump in $180m of council dollars when the grant is exhausted.</p> <p><br /> </p> <p><b>By the numbers:</b></p>

Nissan both recalling thousands more cars.</p> <p>Nissan recalled 10,300 New Zealand vehicles as the fallout from faulty airbags spreads.&nbsp;Also on Wednesday Honda said it was recalling another 16,000 vehicles in New Zealand.</p> <p>Nissan spokesman Peter Fadeyev said&nbsp;Nissan models ranging from 2004 to 2007 were affected by faulty airbags supplied by Japanese parts manufacturer Takata.</p> <p>Details of the models and quantities in the recall were yet to be confirmed, he said.</p> <p>The company would contact customers affected by the recall as soon as parts and more details were available, he said.</p> <p>The recall would be carried out at no cost to customers.&nbsp;</p> <p>Toyota had not recalled the Avensis that Australia had recalled on Thursday afternoon. They had recalled 26,000 cars already.</p> <p>They noted that the Avensis sold in New Zealand was a different one, produced in the United Kingdom. All recall notices came directly from Toyota headquarters in Japan.</p> <p>Spokesperson Morgan Dilks said the recall process was fairly painless for consumers.</p> <p>Toyota dealers all over the country were qualified to check and replace the airbags of the affected models. This would be carried out free of charge.</p> <p>.</p> <p>The Honda recall affects New Zealand-new&nbsp;Honda Civic, Jazz, Accord Euro, and CR-Vs models ranging between 2002 and 2008 which have potentially been fitted with faulty driver or front seat passenger airbags.</p> <p>In 2014 Honda recalled 7000 vehicles in New Zealand for the same issue, taking the total recall to 23,000.</p> <p><b><i>Has your vehicle been recalled? Email us at <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http://newstips@stuff.co.nz\\\">newstips@stuff.co.nz</a></i></b></p> <p>The recall is due to the potentially dangerous deployment of airbags which can send shards of metal flying with the ability to cause injury or death and is part of a worldwide recall of 4.89 million Honda's fitted with airbags from supplier Takata.</p> <p>Honda national service manager Bryan Davis said the driver and front seat passenger airbag inflators of all affected vehicles would be replaced with a new part.</p> <p>&quot;Honda New Zealand has not received any reports of incidents in New Zealand where airbags in vehicles affected by the recall might have deployed abnormally,&quot; Davis said.</p> <p>Honda New Zealand was&nbsp;checking which Japanese used imported Hondas might also be affected.</p> <p>Owners of affected vehicles, who would be identified through registration data, would be contacted by Honda New Zealand, he said.</p> <p>AA motoring advice manager Andrew Bayliss said: &quot;Despite the very small risk, any safety related defect must be treated seriously, but there is no need to panic,&quot; Bayliss said.</p> <p>Given the numbers of vehicles affected, it was unlikely that parts would be available immediately, he said.</p> <p>A reported&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/motoring/news/68691560/air-bag-maker-recalls-34-million-vehicles-in-us\\\">34 million affected vehicles in the United States</a>&nbsp;could potentially be recalled.</p> <p>Various Japanese car makers were affected by the fault with Toyota and Nissan having issued vehicle recalls globally, Bayliss said.</p> <p>Earlier in May Toyota New Zealand&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/motoring/news/68534534/toyota-new-zealand-recalls-cars\\\">recalled 26,000 Corolla, Picnic, Yaris and RAV4 vehicles for a possible airbag fault.</a>&nbsp;as part of a&nbsp;worldwide recall of 5 million Toyotas fitted with Takata airbags.</p> <p>Toyota spokesman Morgan Dilks said Toyota New Zealand was waiting to hear from its head office in Japan if there would be further recalls.</p> <p>Last year Mazda New Zealand recalled 5100&nbsp;New Zealand-new Mazda 6 cars sold in 2002 and 2003 and the used Japanese-import version Mazda Atenza, with front passenger airbags made by Takata.</p> <p>Mazda general manager of vehicle sales and marketing Glenn Harris said on Wednesday Mazda was also waiting to hear from its global head office in Japan if the recall

I don't know where you get these women that push people around... they pushed me in a chair and the chair was not balanced properly and I went down and hurt myself properly.&quot;</p> <p>It remains unclear who it was that Murray was referring to in his complaint.</p> <p>According to the show's website, 11 of 18 staffers at&nbsp;The Last Word&nbsp;are women, not including camera operators.</p> <p>When asked about Murray's comments, an&nbsp;MSNBC&nbsp;spokesperson told&nbsp;The Washington Post, &quot;We're not sure what Bill meant by those comments – we'd suggest asking him, if you&nbsp;haven't&nbsp;already.&quot;</p> <p>In his Letterman appearance earlier in the day, Murray went from Ghostbuster to cake buster after jumping from a giant cake.</p> <p>Murray was the first ever guest on Letterman's&nbsp;Late Night Show&nbsp;in 1982.</p> <p>In his farewell to the 68-year-old host, Murray donned a set of overalls and protective goggles before jumping out of the cake, emblazoned with the words 'Goodbye Dave'.</p> <p>He then took great joy in rubbing the host's suit and hair with cream.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Letterman's final show is screened in New Zealand on Prime on

passenger during a police chase has been jailed for five years.</p> <p>Robert Pora appeared in the High Court at Auckland on Thursday where he was sentenced by Justice Ailsa Duffy for the manslaughter of Steven Henare Te Pania.</p> <p>Pora had earlier pleaded guilty to manslaughter, reckless driving causing injury, driving under the influence of alcohol, failing to stop for police and being an unlicensed driver.</p> <p>Justice Duffy said at about 9.30pm on August 15, 2014, Pora was driving a Mitsubishi car on Puhinui Rd, Manukau, with Te Pania in the front passenger seat.</p> <p>Police saw Pora overtake another vehicle at speed on the suburban road and started a chase, with their lights and sirens activated.</p> <p>The chase reached speeds up to 100kmh, and Pora went through the busy Great South Rd-Puhinui Rd intersection on the wrong side of the road against a red light. &nbsp;</p> <p>In Boundary Rd, he turned his headlights off, but as he went to overtake a vehicle he hit the centre traffic island.</p> <p>&quot;The Mitsubishi has travelled out of control down the wrong side of the road before colliding with an oncoming vehicle,&quot; police said.</p> <p>The car flipped on to its side, and Te Pania was killed in the impact.</p> <p>Pora was extracted from the car by police and ambulance staff and taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries.</p> <p>The driver of the car Pora hit suffered an injury to his left shoulder and was discharged from hospital the following day.</p> <p>Pora was found to have a level of 115 to 127 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, when the legal limit was 80mg.</p> <p>His car was found to have no warrant of fitness or registration.</p> <p>Police said Pora admitted responsibility for the crash, saying he had been drinking before the incident and he was driving at speeds &quot;way over the limit&quot;.</p> <p>He admitted knowing there were deficiencies with the car's tyres and engine, and that he was forbidden to drive.</p> <p>&quot;He complained that the [deceased] had encouraged him to drive off at speed to 'lose' the police during the initial stages of the pursuit,&quot; the police summary said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Victim impact statements were read to the court ​but their contents were suppressed.</p> <p>A letter Pora had written was also read in which he ​said he had caused the death of a close friend &quot;all because of my stupid actions and silly behaviour&quot;.</p> <p>&quot;I am truly sorry.

property prices were revealed on a Ministry website ahead of the Budget, but there are no red faces about it says the Housing Minister.</p> <p>Officials have been examining what the Crown owns, which is now surplus to needs, as the Government looks to use 430 hectares of reserves, defence land and property once earmarked for schools and hospitals to develop housing to be sold.</p> <p>Labour has dismissed the plan as dusting off old policy seven years too late.</p> <p>Although the process was planned to be announced as part of Thursday's Budget, details of the plans to bring in private sector companies were added to the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment website on Tuesday.</p> <p>But Housing Minister Nick Smith said he instructed the Ministry to push ahead with inviting interested parties to a function next week.</p> <p>&quot;I'm not at all concerned about it - in fact I was in Christchurch some weeks ago and spoke to media and indicated the Government was proceeding with a similar programme in Auckland,&quot; he told Radio NZ.</p> <p>He said it was only the amount set aside in the Budget for the housing initiative that was being kept under wraps.</p> <p><b>SO WHAT LAND WILL BE DEVELOPED?&nbsp;</b></p> <p>An initial invitation to take part in a tender to develop housing on Crown land in Auckland says that the ministry will conduct &quot;an open contestable process to identify a shortlist of suitably qualified parties or consortia with the capability and capacity to deliver housing developments at pace in Auckland&quot;.</p> <p>Land being considered for development and sale includes farmland, that held by tertiary institutions, health boards, the defence force, holdings of Housing New Zealand and even land designated as reserves owned by the Department of Conservation.</p> <p>Smith wouldn't confirm how many houses would be built on the 430 hectares of land being put aside for the development other than to say it would certainly be in the thousands.</p> <p>&quot;It's a very large mix and there's a significant amount of it,&quot; Smith said. While there some &quot;very precious nature reserves&quot; which would never be considered for sale, many others were effectively vacant.</p> <p>&quot;You'd be quite astounded by some areas of reserves - and when you say the word reserve you assume that's a park and somebody using it - of land that's effectively vacant and being under utilised,&quot; he said. Some land zoned as reserves <g class=\\\"gr_ gr_103 gr-alert gr_gramm Grammar multiReplace\\\" data-gr-id=\\\"103\\\"> was </g> currently being used as a construction yard, he said.</p> <p>&quot;What I've been surprised by is how poorly government agencies generally manage their land holdings, that you can have quite significant blocks of land sitting around unused &nbsp;for large periods and so I'm having a close and hard look at where there are land holdings, held by government agencies that will help deal with the challenges over housing that we have in Auckland.&quot;</p> <p>Land which the Government was developing in Weymouth had been held for the Ministry of Education and then the Ministry of Social Development for more than 20 years &quot;during which period there was high housing need in South Auckland. Frankly, government agencies should have gone into action a lot earlier in utilising that land&quot;.</p> <p><b>READ MORE: <br /> <a href=\\\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/home-property/68710603/could-the-government-fund-more-housing-using-foreign-money\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">*Could the government fund more housing using foreign money?<br /> </a><a href=\\\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/Budget-2015.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">*Full coverage: Budget 2015</a></b></p> <p>There would be some issues to overcome with local iwi due to the restraints on some of the land around <g class=\\\"gr_ gr_88 gr-alert gr_gramm Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\\\" data-gr-id=\\\"88\\\"> first </g> right of refusal, Smith told Radio NZ.</p> <p>It was an issue that would need to be worked through in the same way that the Government would be looking at land set aside for schools that hadn't seen any development in 20 years.</p> <p>&quot;The key issue for Government is where there is no obvious use in the next 10 to 15 years, could it be used for housing.&quot;</p> <p>Labour housing spokesman Phil Twyford said National's plans were simply a dusting &quot;off Labour's 2008 inventory of government land available for housing&quot; and re-announced it.</p> <p>&quot;Despite National ridiculing this at the time, it is a no-brainer to develop vacant government land in Auckland,&quot; Twyford said</p> <p>&quot;The Government should have continued Labour's work in this area seven years ago. If it had, we would have had thousands of new homes and the housing crisis might not be as bad.</p> <p>Twyford said given the lack of action over seven years, the addition of 430 hectares of Crown land is unlikely to have much effect on house prices.</p> <p>&quot;A shortfall of 20,000 homes has built up under this Government. Auckland needs 13,000 a year just to keep up with population growth and consent figures show a build rate of less than 8000 a year,&quot; Twyford said.</p> <p>&quot;The shortage is getting worse by the day, which is why house prices went up more than $100,000 in the past year.&quot;</p> <p>Green Party co-leader Metiria Turei said the Government must guarantee 100 <g class=\\\"gr_ gr_84 gr-alert gr_spell ContextualSpelling ins-del\\\" data-gr-id=\\\"84\\\"> per cent </g> of the homes built on the 430 hectares would be dedicated affordable housing - the housing crisis wouldn't be fixed by building houses that Aucklanders couldn't afford to buy. &nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;They must not sell it off to private developers for private purposes - it is public land, it should be used for affordable housing for New Zealanders who are struggling.</p> <p>&quot;What constitutes affordable, of course, <g class=\\\"gr_ gr_82 gr-alert gr_gramm Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\\\" data-gr-id=\\\"82\\\"> depends </g> - the Government seems to think that New Zealand families can afford a house of over half a million dollars - that's just simply not true.&quot;</p> <p>The Government needed to invest in building affordable homes that were about three or four times the average wage, Turei said. &nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;Part of the problem in Auckland now is that property developers have no incentive to build houses to be sold at anything other than market rates – that's why the Government needs to step in and make it a condition of the land development that they're not.&quot;</p> <p>The Government had had the land the whole time it had been in power, and had been <g class=\\\"gr_ gr_80 gr-alert gr_spell ContextualSpelling\\\" data-gr-id=\\\"80\\\"> berating </g> Auckland Council about releasing land for housing while &quot;sitting on a gold mine which they could have been using for years now to build housing.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;So it's disgraceful that they've come to this so late, but the fact is, they have land, it's public land, they need to engage in building homes that are affordable and available to low-income New Zealanders.&quot;</p> <p>The Budget was the Government's chance to &quot;finally do something meaningful on housing,&quot; Turei said.</p>\",\n            \"images\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": 11814229,\n

</a></b>Little did Jessica know Thomas had also arranged to come on the show, appearing on Norton's notorious red chair in the hopes of rescheduling the date on national television.<br /> <br /> &quot;I asked a girl out a couple of weeks ago and she said yes,&quot; said Thomas, as Kylie gasped and Jessica looked mortified.</p> <p>&quot;She cancelled on me once and we rescheduled for tonight and she cancelled on me again so she could come here and watch Kylie Minogue. As I had no plans for tonight I thought I'd come down here and see if she wanted to rearrange for next week.&quot;</p> <p>Jessica then had to decide whether to flip Thomas or let him walk. To the shock of the audience, she made the ruthless decision to flip him.</p> <p>As Norton said, Thomas was &quot;literally dumped&quot;.<br /> <br /> But the story had a happy ending. On Twitter, it emerged that Thomas and Jessica had in fact rescheduled their date - and there were no hard feelings between the pair.</p> <p>&quot;I don't hold anything against Jessica,&quot; Thomas tweeted.<br /> <br /> &quot;She's actually lovely.

year to bring the Tainui child, along with nine human vertebrae, a coffin with the remains of three humans and a mummified and tattooed Maori skull.</p> <p>&quot;We are extremely thankful to the&nbsp;Weltmuseum Wien (World Museum Vienna) and the Austrian Government for their approval to&nbsp;return these tupuna,&quot; Te Papa's Kaihautu Dr Arapata Hakiwai said.</p> <p>&quot;Their genuine

taonga and the vertebrae and coffin were also from his collections.</p> <p>The toi moko (skull) was collected by Johann Georg Schwarz.</p> <p>The remains would be formally welcomed home at a ceremony at Te Papa on Monday, May 25.</p> <p>Once they had gone through quarantine, conservation and research processes they would be returned to their whanau.</p>\",\n            \"images\": [\n

changer&quot; for Rotorua.</p> <p>Speaking at the tourism industry TRENZ conference in Rotorua on Wednesday, Key said the investment from the Tourism Growth Partnerships fund into the World Spa development would provide a boost to the New Zealand economy and create additional jobs.</p> <p>&quot;The World Spa project aims to develop an international standard spa and wellness complex on Rotorua's lakefront. The Rotorua Lakes Council has set a goal of 1.5 million commercial spa visits yearly, and the development of this new spa will certainly help with achieving that goal,&quot; he said.</p> <p>The spa complex, which is being led by Pukeroa Oruawhata Group and World Spa Ltd, is expected to cost approximately $10 million and is expected to provide between $36 and $48 million in economic benefits to New Zealand, with a large chunk of that cash staying in Rotorua.</p> <p>World Spa director Peter Sharplin said the finished development would be unlike any other spa seen to date and would draw on the expertise of international spa consultants.</p> <p>&quot;The aim is to develop an entirely new format of spa offering that complements, rather than necessarily competes with existing spas,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Pukeroa Oruawhata Group's Peter Faulkner described the scale of the development as a &quot;game changer&quot; for Rotorua.</p> <p>He said the stage-built development is expected to open in 2017 and at capacity will provide 120 new jobs.</p> <p>Rotorua MP Todd McClay welcomed the development and said tourism was worth $500 million to the Rotorua economy each year.</p> <p>&quot;The spa and hotel facility will be the first stage of a multi-million dollar redevelopment of 11 hectares of prime lakefront property close to the CBD that will transform the central city and will attract more visitors to Rotorua,&quot; he said.</p> <p>The development has also been welcomed by Rotorua Mayor Steve Chadwick, who said it fitted RLC's vision for the district to reclaim its title of 'Spa capital of the South Pacific.'</p> <p>&quot;The funding will provide a boost towards progressing the work that has been underway for some time,&quot; she said.</p> <p>&quot;It's great to have central government endorsing our vision to be a world class spa destination. Rotorua has a hot springs heritage that dates back to its earliest Maori residents. We believe the potential for spa and spa-related developments is huge. It could be what takes our tourism industry to the next level and I look forward to further progress.&quot;</p> <p>The spa complex, which is being led by Pukeroa Oruawhata Group and World Spa Ltd, is expected to cost approximately $10 million and aims to tap into the 3.2 million yearly visitors to Rotorua, as at present only 500,000 commercial spa visits are made annually.&nbsp;</p> <p>However, news of the $350,000 investment has been criticised by lobby group The Taxpayers' Union, whose executive director Jordan Williams described it as &quot;corporate welfare at its very worst.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;This is taxpayer money going to build a spa in Rotorua. That's not innovation,&quot; Williams said.</p> <p>&quot;The problem with these sorts of grants is it allocates taxpayer money to the industries and regions favoured by politicians.&quot;</p> <p>McClay, however, rejected the criticism and invited Williams to visit the regions receiving Government support rather than &quot;criticising from the comfort of his chair in Wellington.&quot;</p> <p>While he said the Taxpayers' Union had a role to play in monitoring the spending of taxpayer cash, he said they may be perceived as only ever critical and not constructive.</p> <p>&quot;I will continue to advocate strongly for Rotorua tourism and Rotorua jobs,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</p>\",\n            \"images\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": 11808804,\n
